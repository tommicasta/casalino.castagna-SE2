\subsection{Tools}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mockito:} java framework developed to support the integration and the testing activities through the creation of so-called \textit{Mock components}. In this projects, it supports the bottom-up strategy, providing at each step of the integration activity the required drivers.

	\item \textbf{Arquillian:} java framework developed to support the testing activity through the definition of annotations and components, such as the \textit{Container Adapter}, in order to ease the testing of containters.

	\item \textbf{JMeter:} software used to execute performance and stress analysis against the subsystems through the creation of custom data loads.
It's used to test the integration between the webserver and the business logic, simulating different and several requests forwarded to the former.

	\item \textbf{Junit:} java testing framework developed to support the unit testing activity. It's used to perform unit testing over indipendent and integrated components. 

	\item \textbf{Code inspection:} manual testing tool used as a preliminary analysis of the individual components implementation.
