\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}

In this section are described what tools and equipment are used to aid the integration and testing activity and how they insert, easing the overall process.

Some of the tools here presented refer to architectures implemented through the Java Enterprise Edition technology, which is one of the most spread technology, but is possible to find equivalent tools for other technologies as well, i.e. Nunit for unit testing on C\#-based architectures.
