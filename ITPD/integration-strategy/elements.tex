\subsection{Elements to be Integrated}

In the following, the system's elements to be integrated are spotted and described. With \textit{elements} here we mean the subsystems composing the system's design. The description of a subsystem is recursive, meaning that if a subsystem is composed by other subsystems, even these are described. Description of atomic components is avoided since are well described into the DD.
