\section{Program Stubs and Test Data Required}

In this section we are presenting the drivers and stubs that have to be created
in order to test our system.
Since we are using a bottom-up approach we will be developing different drivers
that allow us to simulate parts of the system that are not yet implemented.

\begin{description}

  \item[A populated test database:] The database has to contain a small set of all
  the entities needed to the system to work properly.

  \item[Map Manager Driver:] This driver uses the functionalities exposed by the
  \textbf{Area Manager} and the \textbf{Vehicle manager}. It should be developed
  in two different steps, in the first step will be developed and tested the part
  related to the vehicle manager, while in the second step the functions relative
  to the area manager will be tested.

  \item[Maintenace Manager Driver:] The development of this driver can also be
  separated into two different parts, the first one regarding the
  \textbf{Vehicle Manager}, and the second one regarding the \textbf{Area Manager}.

  \item[Account Manager Driver:] This is the driver used while testing the
  \textbf{Driving License Manager} and the \textbf{Payment Manager} components that
  are used during the \textit{registration} of a user.

  \item[Reservation Manager Driver:] This driver that is the one used to simulate
  the action of a user reserving a car. It is used to perform the integration test
  on the \textbf{Fares and Policies Manager} component, the
  \textbf{Vehicle Manager} component, the \textbf{Payment Manager} component and
  on the \textbf{Map Manager} component.

  \item[Authentication Manager Driver:] This is the driver situated at the highest
  level of the bottom-up hierarchy, it is used to test the full functionalities of
  system. This driver exploits the \textbf{Abbount Manager} component, the
  \textbf{Reservation Manager} component and the \textbf{Maintenance Manager}
  component.
