\subsection{High-level components and their interaction}

A high-level view of the components composing the system is represented in the component diagram below [figure \ref{fig:high-lev-comp-diag}.
Each component provides an interface through which the other components can interacts with the component.
Note that not all the components represented, like the Browser, are actually components of the final system but are part of the environment with which the system will interact.
