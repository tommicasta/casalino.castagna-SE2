\subsection{Other design decisions}

\label{sec:other-design-decisions}

Other design decision not taken in account in previous sections are here exposed and discussed.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Demilitarized Zone}: since our system is connected to the internet, all the services exposed by the system and used by the system are publicy available and accessible. This is true not only for the web server services but, for instance, even for the database server, which services are used to access and manage data. 

In general, exposing services that directly manage sensitive informations or performe high-risk operations is not a secure choice. One of the most common and reliable architectural choice to increase the security of the system is the creation of a \textit{Demilitarized Zone}, also abbreviated as \textit{DMZ}. In our architecture, a DMZ is created by means of two firewalls, one placed in front of the web server tier, one in front of data tier. This configuration place implicity into the DMZ the web server tier and the application tier.
\end{itemize}
