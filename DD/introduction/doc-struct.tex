\subsection{Document Structure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Introduction}: an introduction to the document and its content is presented, describing the purpose and the scope of the Design Document. Other informations useful for the understaing of the text, such as definitions and acronyms, are shown and explained.
	\item \textbf{Architectural Design}: a functional description of the system is given, indentifing the main component that satisfies the functional requirements described in the RASD, describing their interactions, the interfaces they require and provides and how they will be deployed.
Architectural styles and patterns used to satisfy the performances and non-functional requirements are described briefly, along with other design decisions.
	\item \textbf{Algorithm Design}: the most relevant algorithms supporting the functionalities of the system are presented and described.
	\item \textbf{User Interface Design}: a complete description of the design of user interfaces are shown, extending and completing the work did in the RASD.
	\item \textbf{Requirements Traceability}: a description about how the architectural design choices map and satisfy the requirements, both functionals and non-functionals, identified in the RASD is presented.
	\item \textbf{Effort Spent}: here the effort spent by each member of the group in term of hours is shown.
	\item \textbf{References}: this section contains a more detailed description of the main documents used to draw up this Design Document.
\end{enumerate}
