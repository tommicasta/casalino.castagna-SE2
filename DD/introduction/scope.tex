\subsection{Scope}

The system to be developed aims to support the services offered by the car sharing service through a set of funcionalities.
The hereby Design Document present the software system architecture through a set of descriptions that try to cover all the relevant aspects from different points of view.

The main focus is given to the identification of the functional components composing the software system, namely the software units with the task of provide the functionalities individuated in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document.
The discussion is completed with a description of the component's interaction, their deployment and the interfaces that they expose and require.

Enough room is reserved for the description of the design choices and other kind of choices chosen to support the architecture in terms of performances and non-functional requirements, pointing out how they integrate with the architecture and the main reason for their use.

This Design Document takes in account the most relevant algorithms for the software system, showing an overview of their structure, and the design of the user interfaces, extending and completing the description done through the user interfaces mockups in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document.
