\subsection{Non-functionals Requirements}

Unlike the previous subsection, here is given more emphasis to the non-functional requirements, mapping them to the design choices.

To have a better understanding about how the design choices satisfy the related requirements, see the \textit{\nameref{sec:selected-styles-patterns}} and \textit{nameref{sec:other-design-decisions}} sections.
