\section{Other issues}

We're not enirely sure about the following mistakes we found, the following list
could be submitted to the writers of the code in order to better understand the
behavior of the application and possibly fix it.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item At \textbf{L.194} there is a suspect block of code:
		\begin{algorithm}
		\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\setcounter{ALG@line}{193}

			\State $ catNameField = (String) childContext.get("groupName"); $
			\State $ title = catNameField; $
			\State $ josonMap.put("title",title); $

		\end{algorithmic}
		\end{algorithm}

		Particularly the use of the variable \textcolor{blue}{title} is unnecessary if
		we directly associate the key \textit{"title"} to the value of the variable
		\textcolor{blue}{catNameField}.

\item At \textbf{L.206} there's a suspect \textcolor{blue}{if} statement:

	\begin{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\setcounter{ALG@line}{205}

		\State  if (UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(childOfSubComs) ||
		\State\hspace{13em}  UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(isPosition)) \{
		\State\hspace{0.5em}  josonMap.put("state", "closed");
		\State  \}

	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}

	This piece of code sets the \textit{"state"} attribute of a node to
	\textit{"closed"} when either there is a child node or there is a employment
	position for the specified node.

	Just by looking at this class we can assume that this is an incorrect
	implementation since is logic to think that a node is considered
	\textit{"closed"} when it has no child and it doesn't have any employment
	position related to it.

\end{enumerate}
