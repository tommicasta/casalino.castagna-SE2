\section{Tasks schedule}

This project in composed of 5 main parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Requirements Analysis and Specification Document
	\item Design Document
	\item Integration Testing Plan Document
	\item Project Plan Document
	\item Development
\end{enumerate}

The first four parts of the project had a deadline already established, instead
we assumed that twelve months are needed in order to complete the implementation
part. Details on this timing can be found in the \textit{Project Size, Effort
and Cost Estimation} section, considering we're still in an early design stage
these numbers may vary greatly. Even though the implementation tasks are
perfectly ordered one after the other, during the implementation it is likely
that this order will not be followed due to possible errors or changes in the
system structure.

The following images show the tasks related to this project.
