\subsubsection{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cost Driver}: team or project factor having a relevant impact on the estimated costs of the project.
        \item \textbf{External Input}: elementary process in which data crosses the boundary from outside to inside. The data contained in the external input may be used to maintain one or more internal logical files.
        \item \textbf{External Inquiry}: elementary process with both input and output components that result in data retrieval from one or more internal logical files and external interface files, without their modification.
        \item \textbf{External Interface File}: a user identifiable group of logically related data used by the application to provide part of its functionalities. The data resides entirely outside the application boundary.
        \item \textbf{Internal Logical File}: a user identifiable group of logically related data that resides entirely within the application boundary, usually mantained by mean of external inputs.
        \item \textbf{External Output}: elementary process in which data generated by ILFs elaborations passes across the boundary from inside to outside.
	\item \textbf{Gearing Factor}: conversion factor used to convert in SLOC the size estimation expressed in function points.
	\item \textbf{Kilo-Source Lines Of Code}: metric identical to the SLOC but the number of code lines is expressed in thousands.
	\item \textbf{Partial Function Points}: function points estimation related to a given project's functionality.
	\item \textbf{Persons-Month}: metric used to measure the effort required for project's development. 
	\item \textbf{Source Lines Of Code}: a metric used to estimated the size of a software project by the number of expected lines of source code.
	\item \textbf{Scale Driver}: project or team dependent factor having a relevant impact on the estimated size of the project itself.
	\item \textbf{Total Effort Multiplier}: multiplier encasing the contributions brought by each cost driver.
	\item \textbf{Total Scale Driver}: the total scale driver factor impacting on the project's size.
	\item \textbf{Unadjusted Function Points}: simple equation used to compute the total amount of function points assigned to the project under analysis.
