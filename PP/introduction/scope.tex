\subsection{Scope}

The project planning document gives a first and broad estimation of the costs, time and effort required to develop the final product.
All these aspects are faced and explored in details in each of the 4 main sections composing this document:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Size, effort and cost estimations}: estimated figures for size, costs, effort and time required to accomplish the final goal of the project are here presented, describing in details the estimation process and rationale followed, along with the mathematical tools exploited.

	\item \textbf{Schedule}: using as an input the outcomes derived by the estimation activities presented in the previous section, a first detailed scheduling of project's tasks is provided.

	\item \textbf{Resource allocation}: here the mapping between members of the team and the various task composing the whole project's life-cycle is shown.

	\item \textbf{Risk management}: any risk that may arise in any phase of the project is described and a rough possible solution, either to avoid the risk and either to recover the situation in case it occurs, is presented.
\end{itemize}
