Applying the equation above shown, the unadjasted function point value is equal to 221 points.
To give much flexibility as possible to the project, the gearing factors used to estimate the lower bound and the upper bound are calculated as the
mathematical average between the gearing factors of J2EE and .NET, the two most widespread technologies.

Lower bound : 52 * 221 = 11.492 kilo-lines of code
Upper bound : 64 * 221 14.144 kilo-lines of code
