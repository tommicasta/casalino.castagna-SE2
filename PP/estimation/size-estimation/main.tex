\subsection{Size Estimation}

As explained in the introductory paragraph to this section, the size estimation effort is based on the estimation of the so-called \textit{Function points}. Function points are a statistical method of estimate the size of a software project evaluating the different the functionalities provided by the software product in exam.

According to this approach, functionalities are divided into 5 \textbf{function types}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Internal Logical File.}
	\item \textbf{External Logical File.}
	\item \textbf{External Input.}
	\item \textbf{External Output.}
	\item \textbf{External Inquiry.}
\end{itemize}

For each of these type, a \textbf{weight} is associated. These weights are statistically determinated and vary according to the \textbf{complexity} of the function type.
The complexity of a function type is not predefined and is subject to the software product to be developed and to the opinion of the project manager.
