\section{Project Size, Effort and Cost Estimation}

In this section the estimation process of the three key aspects for an effective project planning, namely \textbf{size}, \textbf{effort} and \textbf{costs} expected, is described in details, pointing out the rationale of each single step of the process itself.

The \textbf{size estimation} process is led by a \textbf{functionality-provided} based approach, whereby the estimation is performed according to the functionalities that the software product is planned to provide. To support this strategy, \textbf{Function Points} technique is used. 

Regarding the \textbf{effort and cost} estimation, the evaluation is based on \textbf{COCOMO II}, an \textbf{algorithmic model} based on a simple equation which output depends on several factors regarding the project.

All the estimations described in the following sections are performed according to the \textbf{Early-design model}. We have chosen to adopt this model since we are asked to implement a new software service, with any legacy software/hardware to integrate, or pre-requisite regarding the software architecture.
