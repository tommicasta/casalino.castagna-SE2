\section{Project Size, Effort and Cost Estimation}

In this section the estimation process of the three key aspects for an effective project planning, namely size, effort and costs expected, is described in details, pointing out the rationale of each single step of the process itself.

The size estimation process is led by a \textbf{functionality-provided} based approach, whereby the estimation is made according to the functionalities that the software product is planned to provide. To support this strategy, \textit{Function Points} technique is used. 

Regarding the effort and cost estimation, the process is based on \textbf{algorithmic approach}, that is the use of an algorithmic model based on a simple equation which output depends on several factors regarding the project. The algorithmic model here used is based on \textit{COCOMO II}.
