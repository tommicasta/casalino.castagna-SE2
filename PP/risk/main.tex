\section{Risk Management}

In this section of the document we will be focusing on the possible risks on
which we may incur. We can devide those risks into three different categories:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Project risks
	\item Technical risks
	\item Business risks
\end{itemize}

In order to minimize the chances of possible risks to happen and damages
deriving from them we decided to use a proactive risk approach. This approach
consists of identifying possible risks, analyzing them and to develop a
contingency plan in order to manage the consequences deriving from those
problems.

with their probability and estimated effects on the project
