\subsection{Project Risks}

This is a list of possible project risks in which we may incur during the
realization of the project.

\begin{description}
	\item [Changes in project requirements: ] This may happen for various reasons,
		and cannot be prevented. We can only mitigate the consequences of this
		problem by writing code that is easily maintanable and extensible.
	\item [Lack of familiarity with the used technologies: ] This problem will
		probably occur due to the fact that the team has never programmed before
		using Java EE. This could have been originally avoided by hiring programmers
		that alredy had some experience with the selected frameworks.
	\item [Unrealistic deadlines: ] This is one of the most occurring problems in
		this kind of projects. A possible solution to it could be a first release of
		the system that is working but doesn't include all the side functionalities,
		that will be implemented later in time.
	\item [Staff ill or quitting the company: ] This is another unpredictable risk
		in the project. In order to mitigate the consequences we can split the
		responsibilities among multiple people so that no one is essential to the
		development of the project.
