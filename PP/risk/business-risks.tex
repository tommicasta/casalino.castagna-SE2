\subsection{Business Risks}

A list of possible business risks in which we may incur during the realization
of the project.

\begin{description}
  \item [Internal bankruptcy: ] This problem has catastrophic consequences on
    the project and can only be avoided with a good feasibility study providing
    all the anticipated costs of the project.
  \item [External suppliers bankruptcy: ] This problem can be avoided in some
    measure by investigating in the financial condition of the society we want
    to rely on. Another solution can be to have a backup offer for a different
    supplier.
  \item [Changes in laws regulating key aspects of the project: ] This problem
    should not materialize since we are using electrical cars with no toxic
    emissions. However it may happen that parts of our car fleet will become
    forbidden by law (e.g. certain type of battery cells). In order to prevent
    this kind of problems we must perform a research on the most recent
    technologies used in the fields in which our project is involved.
